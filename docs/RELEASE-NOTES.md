# Release Notes

These notes summarize notable website updates by release.
Version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## v1.4.0 — June 2, 2026

### Added
- **ES module architecture** — Core runtime JS migrated to `import`/`export`; HTML pages updated to `<script type="module">` where applicable.
- **`lang-utils.js`** — Extracted pure `detectLanguage` function for browser-independent use and unit testing.
- **`verse-utils.js`** — Extracted pure `parseVerseAndReference` and `BIBLE_BOOK_PATTERN` for browser-independent use and unit testing.
- **Unit tests** — `node --test` suite in `tests/unit/` covering `detectLanguage`, `buildPageConfig`, `parseVerseAndReference`, and `BIBLE_BOOK_PATTERN`; `npm run test:unit` script added to `package.json`.
- **`"type": "module"` in `package.json`** — Aligns Node.js module resolution with the ES module source base.

### Changed
- **Build** — `main.js`, `newsletter.js`, `youtube.js`, and `calendar-events.js` now use `bundle: true` + `format: 'esm'` in esbuild; `consent.js` uses `format: 'esm'`; `analytics.js` stays classic (synchronous consent-mode script).
- **`page-config.min.js` removed** — `page-config.js` is now bundled into `main.min.js`; standalone script tag removed from all 9 HTML pages.
- **`newsletter.min.js`** — Now bundles `youtube.js` and `verse-utils.js`; `youtube.min.js` tag removed from `newsletter.html`.
- **AbortController for language fetches** — `loadLanguageFile` in `main.js` aborts any in-flight fetch before starting a new one.
- **`// @ts-check`** — Added to all JS source files for TypeScript-grade type checking without a compilation step.
- **`scripts/build.js`** — Converted from CommonJS `require()` to ESM `import` statements.
- **`sw.js` caching strategy** — Added a dedicated network-first rule for `/assets/programs/verse-today.json` (with cached fallback when offline) so daily devotional updates no longer require manual cache clears.
- **Service worker cache version** — Bumped from `cksda-v1` to `cksda-v2` to roll out the verse JSON cache-strategy update immediately.
- **`calendar-events.js` module shape** — Removed top-level IIFE wrapper and aligned with the ESM source pattern.
- **`eslint.config.js`** — Migrated config file to ESM and split lint targets by actual module type (ESM vs classic script vs CommonJS test/config files).

### Fixed
- **YouTube iframe API callback in ESM** — `onYouTubeIframeAPIReady` is now attached to `window`, restoring player initialization after the ESM migration.
- **Lychee CI failures from stale local links** — Updated `docs/2026-05-29-ImprovementSuggestions.md` to remove markdown links pointing to deleted `assets/js/browser.min.js` and `assets/js/breakpoints.min.js`.

### Removed
- **Stale build artifact** — Deleted `assets/js/page-config.min.js` and removed its pre-cache reference from `sw.js`.

---

## v1.3.5 — June 1, 2026

### Added
- **Lang/theme switcher** — EN / 한 / ES + three-state theme toggle (◐ system / light / dark) rendered at the bottom of the footer; preference saved to `localStorage`.
- **Page view transitions** — `@view-transition` CSS rule + `initViewTransitions()` JS wired on all same-origin navigations.
- **Back-to-top button** — fixed bottom-right button appears after scrolling; respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### Changed
- **Footer** — reduced top margin on copyright links (`3em → 0.75em`) to tighten spacing between the copyright line and the legal links below it.
- **Footer content layout** — rebuilt into tile-style sections (Pastors, Worship Services, Contact & Location) with centered content and cleaner spacing.
- **Footer contact actions** — simplified to text-first links: address lines open Google Maps and phone uses `tel:`.
- **Home page footer content** — Worship Services section is conditionally hidden on the home page.
- **Calendar CTA** — removed the separate ICS download action and kept a single prominent "Open in Google Calendar" button.
- **Light theme transitions** — restored top and bottom triangular separators in light mode and aligned manual `theme-light` overrides with system-light styling.
- **Light header background** — increased gradient contrast so the header transition reads more clearly in light mode.
- **AdventistGiving header links** — changed `rel` from `noopener noreferrer` to `noopener` so AdventistGiving can receive referral traffic while still keeping `target="_blank"` protection.
- **Build parity** — updated both `assets/js/main.js` and `assets/js/main.min.js` for the same AdventistGiving link behavior in production.

### Fixed
- **Calendar** — private and confidential Google Calendar events are now filtered out before rendering, preventing them from appearing as "Untitled Event".
- **Theme mismatch** — fixed a light-mode inconsistency where the header was using light transition assets while the footer could still resolve to dark transition assets under manual theme toggles.
- **Calendar button contrast** — improved dark-mode readability for the "Open in Google Calendar" CTA.
- **Newsletter Lesson Section** — corrected the Korean lesson label from "EM / Young Adults" to "KM / Gaon" to match the linked Korean lesson.
- **`verse-today.json`** — manually restored to the correct June 1 verse after a force push wiped two workflow-authored commits.
- **`update-verse.yml`** — replaced hardcoded `UTC-5` offset with `ZoneInfo('America/New_York')` so the daily verse date is DST-aware (correct in both EST and EDT); replaced dual midnight EST/EDT cron entries with a single hourly schedule (`17 * * * *`) to avoid GitHub schedule jitter.
- **PWA icon** — corrected `manifest.json` icon order so the dark icon is the default and the light icon is served when `prefers-color-scheme: light` is active (was reversed).
- **Footer copyright links** — applied `display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap` to the copyright `<ul>` so links no longer crowd or wrap awkwardly on iPhone widths.

### Removed
- **Inner-page breadcrumbs** — removed auto-injected "Home / Page" breadcrumb navigation so only the top header menu is used.

---

## v1.3.4 — May 30, 2026

### Changed
- Deploy workflow now strips `docs/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, `test-results/`, `playwright-report/`, `node_modules/`, and dev config files before uploading the Pages artifact, preventing operational/internal files from being publicly served.

---

## v1.3.3 — May 30, 2026

### Fixed
- **`main.js`** — Ministry pages no longer show the church mission subtitle; empty-string subtitles now correctly suppress the fallback to `_subtitle` (changed `||` to `??`).

---

## v1.3.2 — May 31, 2026

### Added
- **Month grid view** — a full 7-column calendar grid with prev/next month navigation, today highlight, and event pills per day cell; toggled from a new "List / Month" segmented control above the events.
- **Event popup** — clicking any event pill in the month grid opens a centered modal with full event details (date, time, location, description, "Add to Google Calendar" link); dismissed via close button, backdrop click, or Escape key.
- **Mobile dots** — on ≤480 px screens, event pills in the month grid collapse to small colored dots (still tappable for the popup) to keep the grid usable.
- **"+N more" overflow** — days with more than 3 events show a "+N more" button that switches to the list view.

### Changed
- **`calendar-events.js`** — rewritten with module state (`currentView`, `viewYear`, `viewMonth`), `renderListContent()`, `renderMonthContent()`, `refresh()`, `showEventPopup()`, and a `renderViewToggle()` helper; `timeMin` now starts from the beginning of the current month so the grid is fully populated; `MAX_EVENTS` increased to 60.
- **CSS** — added view toggle, month grid, popup, and mobile dot styles to `main.css`, `lightmode.css`, and `darkmode.css`.
- **`newsletter.js`** — `updateLessonLinks` now auto-computes the week number and day-within-lesson-week for all Sabbath School lesson tile links; only the HTML fallback values need updating when the quarterly lesson set changes.

---

## v1.3.1 — May 30, 2026

### Added
- **Events summary bar** — a "X upcoming events across N months" line appears above the event cards once loaded, powered by the existing Google Calendar API response.
- **"Open in Google Calendar" CTA button** — a teal pill button with a calendar icon now replaces the plain text link at the bottom of the calendar page; styled for both light and dark mode.

### Changed
- **`calendar.html`** — removed the `RSVP.major` / `calFSMsg` section; replaced with static `events-gcal-cta` button and new `events-summary` container.
- **`page-config.js`** — removed `calFSMsg` from the calendar page `init` (no longer needed).
- **CSS** — added `.events-summary`, `.events-gcal-cta`, `.events-gcal-btn` to `main.css`, `lightmode.css`, and `darkmode.css`.

---

## v1.3.0 — May 30, 2026

### Added
- **Calendar events page rework** — `calendar.html` now fetches upcoming events from the Google Calendar API and renders them as styled date-badge cards grouped by month, replacing the plain Google Calendar iframe.
- **`assets/js/calendar-events.js`** — new script that calls the Google Calendar API v3, groups events by month, and renders accessible event cards with date badge, time, optional location, description excerpt, and "Add to Google Calendar" link.
- **Event card CSS** — `.event-card`, `.events-month-group`, `.events-month-heading`, and related classes added to `assets/css/main.css` with responsive mobile stacking at ≤480 px.
- **Light/dark mode event card colors** — teal badge (`#3e8391` / `#2a6d79`) and card backgrounds added to `lightmode.css` and `darkmode.css`.
- **`CALENDAR_API_KEY` build injection** — `scripts/build.js` now injects the `CALENDAR_API_KEY` environment variable into `calendar-events.min.js` via esbuild `define`, matching the existing YouTube key pattern.

### Changed
- **`calendar.html` CSP** — removed `frame-src https://calendar.google.com` and `object-src https://calendar.google.com` directives, which are no longer needed without the embedded iframe.
- **`scripts/build.js`** — added `CALENDAR_API_KEY` env var handling and `calendar-events.js` esbuild task.
- **`assets/js/main.js`** — fixed a pre-existing premature template literal closing backtick in `buildFooter()` that was preventing successful builds.



### Added
- **CSS gradient header** — `header.jpg` replaced with a pure-CSS layered background: two off-screen radial sun glows sweeping in from the top corners, a dark bottom vignette, and a teal-to-navy `linear-gradient`; responsive across three breakpoints (3200 px / 1280 px / 736 px).
- **PWA support** — `manifest.json` with church name, short name, and adaptive theme colours (`#3e8391` light / `#042D2D` dark).
- **Adaptive PWA icons** — four icons (light + dark × 192 + 512 px) generated from `logo-light.png` by `scripts/build.js` using `sharp`, with solid brand-colour backgrounds.
- **Service worker** — `sw.js` at repo root: cache-first for static assets, network-first for navigation, `offline.html` fallback when offline.
- **Offline page** — `offline.html`: self-contained branded fallback, no external dependencies.
- **Service times section** — `index.html` now shows a prominent Korean and English Sabbath School and Worship Service times block, rendered from existing i18n keys with locale-aware `Intl.DateTimeFormat` formatting and a link to the calendar page.
- **`.service-times` CSS** — responsive two-column card grid added to `assets/css/main.css`.
- **Daily Devotional card** — `newsletter.html` verse-of-day section redesigned as a pull-quote card with a pill CTA ("Our High Calling →") linking to the day's devotional; responsive layout (pill left / reference right on ≥600 px, stacked on mobile).
- **Duty row highlight (dark mode)** — active dishwashing duty row now uses a coral/terracotta (`rgba(255,110,60,0.55)`) complement of the site teal for accessible contrast on dark backgrounds.
- **Link checker in CI** — `lycheeverse/lychee-action@v2` added to the `verify` job in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
- **`docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md`** — improvement checklist archived from repo root.

### Changed
- **All 10 HTML pages** — added `<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json" />`, replaced single `theme-color` meta with adaptive light/dark pair, added `worker-src 'self'` to CSP.
- **`assets/js/main.js`** — added service worker registration block; logo `<img>` now has descriptive `alt` text; social icon links include `aria-label` with "(opens in new tab)" and `aria-hidden` span labels.
- **`assets/js/page-config.js`** — added service times HTML to `index` page config `init()`.
- **`scripts/build.js`** — added `generateIcon()` helper for adaptive PWA icon generation.
- **`eslint.config.js`** — added `sw.js` to linted files; added `__YOUTUBE_API_KEY__: 'readonly'` global.
- **CI Node version** — bumped from 20 to 24; added `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24: true` on both `verify` and `deploy` jobs.
- **`calendar.html`** — `<embed>` element now has a descriptive `title` attribute for screen readers.
- **`lightmode.css` / `darkmode.css`** — added `#header p` colour overrides to fix hero subtitle being rendered in low-contrast grey (inherited from generic `header p` rule).
- **`main.css`** — `#header p` top margin increased from `0.25em` to `0.75em` for breathing room between the site title and subtitle; footer `#footer .copyright li` set to `display: inline` at ≤480 px to keep all three items on one line.
- **`docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md`** — all relative links prefixed with `../`; archive date and creation date added to header.

### Fixed
- **CSP `frame-src`** — added `youtube.com` and `youtube-nocookie.com` to `index.html` and `newsletter.html` after YouTube iframe embeds were blocked.
- **CSP `connect-src`** — added `google.com` (GA4 fallback beacon endpoint) to all pages; added `googleapis.com` to `newsletter.html` (required for YouTube Data API calls in `youtube.js` to resolve sermon speaker and scheduled video).
- **Hero subtitle colour** — `header p { color: #888888 }` was overriding the white hero subtitle in both light and dark modes.
- **Newsletter divit/notch** — removed `border-top` from `.verse-of-day` that was showing a teal notch where the card met the page edge.
- **Footer copyright wrapping** — "Privacy Policy" no longer wraps to a new line on small screens.
- **Small-screen newsletter cards** — announcement, service-info, rides, church-notice, and lessons sections go edge-to-edge (no side margins/borders) at ≤400 px.
- **Duty schedule gap** — reduced `.duty-schedule` top margin from `8px` to `2px` to close the gap above the dishwashing table.
- **Skip link class** — unified to `.skip-to-content` across all pages and CSS.
- **Lychee `--exclude-mail` removed** — flag was dropped in lychee v0.23; removed from CI args.
- **Lychee scanning `node_modules`** — narrowed glob from `./**/*.html` to `./*.html ./sitemap.xml ./*.md docs/*.md`.
- **Lychee root-relative links** — added `--root-dir ${{ github.workspace }}` so `/manifest.json` and `/images/...` links resolve correctly.
- **Localhost link in README** — changed `<http://localhost:8000>` to a code span to prevent lychee from attempting to fetch it; added `--exclude 'localhost'` to lychee args.
- **Dead links in IMPROVEMENTS.md** — removed links to deleted `connection.html` and `assets/js/util.js`.

---

- **`eslint.config.js`** — updated to support the build pipeline.
- **`README.md`** — expanded with full setup and development workflow documentation.

### Removed

- **`assets/css/main.css`** — additional CSS normalisation rules.

---

## v1.2.5 — May 30, 2026

### Added
- **`sitemap.xml`** — lists 9 canonical content pages with `<priority>` and `<changefreq>`; epoch, zeitgeist, redirect pages, and privacy policy deliberately excluded.
- **Canonical URL tags** — `<link rel="canonical">` added to all 9 main content pages (`index`, `calendar`, `children`, `epoch`, `music`, `pathfinders`, `personal-ministries`, `young-adults`, `newsletter`; `privacy.html` already had one).
- **JSON-LD structured data** — `Church` schema on `index.html` with address, phone, opening hours, and social `sameAs` links; `WebPage` schema on all other content pages.
- **`robots.txt` Disallow rules** — `epoch.html`, `zeitgeist.html`, and `connection.html` explicitly blocked from all crawlers.
- **Privacy comments** — `robots.txt`, `epoch.html`, and `zeitgeist.html` each have a comment explaining that these pages are blocked because they contain videos featuring minors; notes say not to remove the restrictions without church leadership approval.

- **`epoch.html`** — `noindex, nofollow` robots meta added (previously only `zeitgeist.html` had it); canonical tag removed as unnecessary on a non-indexed page.
- **Connection card fully removed** — `connectionCard`, `connectionCardURL`, and `connectionPage` keys deleted from `en.json`, `es.json`, and `ko.json`; `connection` entry removed from `PAGE_CONFIG` in `main.js`; `connectionLink` removed from the nav builder; `connection.html` deleted.
- **`zeitgeist.html`** — added `noindex, nofollow` with explanatory privacy note.
- **`IMPROVEMENTS.md`** — Section 5 all items marked complete; Section 12 reconciled to reflect work completed across Sections 1–5.

### Fixed
- **Nav link hover invisibility** — `#header a:hover` in `lightmode.css` was `#3E8391` (teal-on-teal, invisible); same issue in `darkmode.css` (`#48727A`); `#ministries:hover` in `menu.css` also affected. All three changed to `#ffffff` so hovered links are visible.

### Removed
- **`connection.html`** — deleted; internal links updated.

---

## v1.2.4 — May 30, 2026

### Changed
- **All pages** — converted `<div>` containers to semantic `<section>`/`<main>`/`<article>`; added visible skip link and focus indicators; standardised `<title>` format; added `<link rel="canonical">`.

- **`assets/langStrings/*.json`** — `advWebsiteTitle` shortened to `"Adventist.org"` in `en.json`, `es.json`, and `ko.json` to prevent footer copyright wrapping.

---

## v1.2.3 — May 29, 2026

### Added

- **GA4 + Clarity on newsletter** — added Consent Mode v2 default-deny block, GA4 `gtag.js` script, and `consent.js` to `newsletter.html` (previously missing analytics coverage).

### Changed
- **`assets/js/main.js`** — anchor tags for tithe paragraph, collegiate links, events, and calendar fullscreen link are now constructed in JS from clean URL keys rather than reading raw HTML from translation strings.
- **`assets/langStrings/*.json`** — added separate `*URL` keys for all link values; HTML markup removed from string values.
- **`calendar.html`** — `calFSMsg` container changed from `<a>` to `<span>` to prevent nested anchor (JS was setting `innerHTML` of an `<a>` to another `<a>`).

---

### Changed

- **`epoch.html`** — removed 2024, 2023, and 2021 sections that contained only "Video information is currently unavailable" placeholders; page now shows only years with real video content (2022 and 2020).
- **`music.html`** — Instagram social link label corrected from "Instagram (Collegiate)" to "Instagram (Music)"; renamed mislabeled `id="personalMinistries*"` attributes.

---
